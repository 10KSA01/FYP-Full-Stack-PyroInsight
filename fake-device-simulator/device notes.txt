PC - Smoke, Heat & Carbon Monoxide (CO)
P  - Smoke 
H  - Heat
PH - Smoke & Heat

Type  - Unit of measurement
Smoke - %/m obscuration
Heat  - Degrees C
CO    - ppm (parts per million)


-----------------
[  ] 100 devices on panels, we could only have a device read over 1 minutes instead of 5 seconds
[  ] Read only photo and heat detectors (P, H, PH and PC device types)
[  ] Heat and obsecuration
[  ] Overall heat that site temperature 
[  ] Obscuration read over time in a site
[  ] Maintenance if obscuration goes below threshold
[  ] Device failure for response rate for certain days and overall
[  ] Health rate is the percentage of number of successful reply over total replies (success reply√∑total reply)
[  ] Graph for temp over time
[  ] Graph for obscuration humi
